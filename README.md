#SaltLAN

Single-server LAN party

## What

The goal of SaltLAN's network and server infrastructure was designed to be small, single-system, and cheap, while meeting all of our requirements: Caching, Game servers, monitoring, and 100Mb/s to the client.

I wanted to build SaltLAN after attending a LAN party in May, 2016. While the LAN was a lot of fun and it featured a great giveaway, awesome unlimited drinks and cool people, however, there were some massive networking problems.

 1. No dedicated LAN servers for games like TF2. People had to try and host local games, but nobody could see/connect to the game.
 2. Bad switches/using home routers instead of an unmanaged switch with distribution switches. Nobody could talk to each other.
 3. Slow internet (20Mbps max). Not everybody had certain games, and the day of the LAN, there was a massive TF2 update. It killed the network several times.
 
 
## Configuration

###Server

//side note:
For anyone who's wondering why I'm releasing **so** much information on the setup and the possibility that this information might lead to a breach of network security:
 1. I am moderately confident in our network security and IDS.
 2. ALL of the network information is readily available to anyone who runs a basic nmap scan at the event.
 3. I want this information to be public. I spent a lot of time piecing pieces of information together from tons of sites and I want it to be available to anybody who looks.
